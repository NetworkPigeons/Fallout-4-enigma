Status: Undetected low-key/closet (community tested on PC, HWID spoof — rage/AC waves ban fast if overused) 🟢🟠

Why this hack survives custom AC in 2026  
- Simple: .exe → Fallout 4 → auto-load  
- Humanized closet: smoothing, realistic FOV, no obvious animations or stats spikes  
- Kernel AC bypass — streamproof overlays, no server-side checks triggered, compatible with all DLCs (Automatron, Wasteland Workshop, Far Harbor, Contraptions Workshop, Vault-Tec Workshop, Nuka-World)  
- ESP: enemies (raiders, super mutants, ghouls, synths, deathclaws, mirelurks, radscorpions, yao guai, feral ghouls, Institute coursers), NPCs (companions, settlers, traders, quest givers), loot crates, collectibles (Bobbleheads, magazines, holotapes, perk magazines, unique weapons/armor), hidden paths, ambushes, guard patrols, weak points on power armor/enemies highlighted  
- Updates post-DLC/patch (new Creation Club content, next-gen ray tracing, 60fps, ultra-widescreen support)  
- No key/sub — loader style  
- Windows 10/11 64-bit (Steam / GOG / Bethesda Launcher)
